# Hi, I'm Homa

I am a Data Scientist and passionate in several areas of data modeling, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis and data visualization. I have passion and drive to simplify problems by building and refining ML models to extract actionable insights from large sets of data that effectively support business decisions. I love to develop, validate and execute algorithms and predictive models to investigate problems, detect patterns and recommend solutions to improve business.

fun fact: I love traveling, reading, cooking and learning different foreign languages!
